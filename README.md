Google is explaining this wrong. So vist these subfolders in order to get a real education about state management which is in fact app architecture in flutter apps:

[Lifting Up State](./lifting_up_state)

[Better Dependency Injection](./better_dependency_injection)

[Better Notifiers](./better_notifiers)

[Better ViewModel Arch](./better_viewmodel_arch)

It's frankly better than reading this disorganized pile of dumpkopf:
